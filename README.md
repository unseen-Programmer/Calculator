I'm excited to share a project I recently worked on: a GUI-based calculator built using Python's Tkinter library.

Features:
✅ Basic Operations: Add, subtract, multiply, and divide with ease.
✅ Responsive UI: Buttons with clean aesthetics and hover effects for a modern look.
✅ Error Handling: Gracefully handles division by zero and invalid inputs.
✅ Decimal Support: Perform calculations with decimal numbers for precise results.
✅ Clear Button: Reset calculations quickly with a single click.
